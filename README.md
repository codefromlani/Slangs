Slangs (Abbreviation Website)

This project is a full-stack application where users can search, view and submit abbreviations with their meanings. The backend is built using FastAPI and connects to a database to store and manage abbreviations. The frontend allows users to interact with the system through search functionality, viewing approved abbreviations, and submitting new ones.

Technologies Used:

- Backend: FastAPI
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Database ORM: SQLAlchemy
- Authentication (JWT): Admin-only access 

Features:

- Search Abbreviations: Users can search for abbreviations and view their meanings (only approved abbreviations are displayed).
- Submit New Abbreviations: Users can submit new abbreviations and their meanings.
- Approve/Reject Abbreviations: Admin users can approve or reject user-submitted abbreviations.
